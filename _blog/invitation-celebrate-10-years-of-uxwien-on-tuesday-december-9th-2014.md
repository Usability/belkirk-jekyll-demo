I would like to invite you to celebrate the 10th anniversary of UxWien.

WHEN  
Tuesday, December 9th 2014 from 7pm to \~11pm

WHERE  
Metalab, Rathausstraße 6, 1010 Vienna

**WHAT happens at a UxWien ?**

We gather at 7pm and supply ourselves with soda or beer. We start with a short intro for first-time visitors, order dinner online and do a round of introduction.

We plan tonight's meetup topics. Geeks like myself prepare a talk with slides, and pre-announce it on [https://ux.piratenpad.de/30](https://ux.piratenpad.de/30 "https://ux.piratenpad.de/30"). Others improvise and shout out a subject they want to discuss during the evening. Both ways are fine.

We have two periodical, recurring topics: Recommended events in or near Vienna and job offers.

Dinner is delivered at 8.30pm. Time for a break. More talks and discussions afterwards. People come and go as they like. Around 11pm class is usually dismissed.

Collaboratively we document each UxWien Meetup at [https://ux.piratenpad.de/30](https://ux.piratenpad.de/30 "https://ux.piratenpad.de/30"). Check out to learn what keep us busy and what you have missed so far.

We do speak English if non-german-speaking guests are present. Otherwise we speak German. That’s how a UxWien Meetup rolls.

**UxWien Meetups are at two locations**

UxWien Metalab Meetup on the 2nd Tuesday of every month – 12 times a year. Metalab is a hacker-space in the 1st district near the city hall. Have a look at their refrigerator to get an idea what a hacker-space is [https://metalab.at/wiki/Fridge](https://metalab.at/wiki/Fridge "https://metalab.at/wiki/Fridge") ;-).

UxWien Sektor5 Meetup upon announcement. Sektor5 is a coworking space in the 5th district.

**UxWien announcements are available here**
